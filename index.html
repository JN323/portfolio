        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Get your ribeye steak and put it in the fridge to let it chill and keep fresh. Hold it there for a few hours preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Once put in the fridge for a while, temper the steak for <b>30 minutes</b>. (Temper means to take out of the fridge)</li>
            <li>Rub the steak with oil on all sides of the steak.</li>
            <li>Season the steak with salt and pepper all around the steak, make sure to tap the seasoning in the steak so it can be flavored and seasoned on all sides and to make sure it won't fall.</li>
            <li>Get a hot pan, put it do medium-high heat, and then proceed to put some olive/avocado oil on the pan.</li>
            <li>Once you can see some smoke come out of the oil, then place the <b>EDGE</b> (Fat Cap) of the steak  on the pan to sear the fat.</li>
            <li>Hold it for about 2 minutes, then drop the steak onto its side in the pan</li>
            <li>Once 4 minutes pass on one side of the steak, flip the steak on its other side and sear it for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once seared for 3 minutes, rest it outside the pan (preferably a grid) for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>During those 5 minutes,turn off the heat, get your garlic, crush it, and put it on the pan</li>
            <li>Also during those 5 minutes get your shallots and 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter into the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat back on to low after the butter has been placed</li>
            <li>Once the butter foams, which is when bubbles appear, then put the steak back in.</li>
            <li>Once put in, begin to baste the steak, which is to take the oil and the sauce from the pan and pour it on the steak, recommended to use a spoon.</li>
            <li>Once basted for a while, drop in your thyme/rosemary</li>
            <li>Keep basting on both sides until it reaches an internal temperature of <b>180 degrees</b>. You can use those cooking thermometers to check that </li>
            <li>Once hit 180 degrees, rest the steak back to where you did previously and rest it for 8 minutes</li>
            <li>Halfway through resting, flip the steak so both sides can be rested. During then, also pour the oil sauce from the pan onto the steak itself.</li>
            <li>Once 8 minutes passes, slice up the steak and <i>bon appetit</i>!</li>
        </ol>
